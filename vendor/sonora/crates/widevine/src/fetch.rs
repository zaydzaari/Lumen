//! Fetching the module from Google's component update service.
//!
//! This is the request Chrome's own component updater makes for the Widevine component, and
//! the one Kodi's InputStream Helper makes for the same file. The answer names the current
//! version and a `.crx3` to download: a signed header in front of an ordinary zip, with the
//! module under `_platform_specific/<os>_<arch>/` and Google's terms in `LICENSE`. The
//! archive's sha256 is checked against the one the service announced before anything is read
//! out of it.
//!
//! Kodi shows those terms and installs only on the user's word, so the download and the
//! install are two steps here: [`offer`] downloads and hands back the terms as an [`Offer`],
//! and [`Offer::install`] puts the module into the store. [`fetch`] runs both for a module the
//! user accepted before, when a newer version is out.
